# Py3QDA Project



## PyQDA

PyQDA in the directory of Py2QDA-0.1.1 is a Python-clone of [RQDA](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/) which was forked from https://github.com/ccbogel/PyQDA



## Py3QDA

PyQDA has been ported to Python 3.6 and PyQt5, and I renamed it to Py3QDA (in the directory of Py3QDA-0.1)



Few new features, such as case profile matrix, have been added to Py3QDA.



### Installation of Py3QDA

1. Install Python 3.6+ and PyQt5 module

   The recommended way is to install [Anaconda (Python 3.6 version)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

   Another way is to install [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/) (The one with Python 3.6+ and QT5)

2. Launch terminal or cmd and run the following command

   ```Python
   python Py3QDA/Py3QDA.py

   # or

   python Path/of/Py3QDA/Py3QDA.py
   ```
   Then you can see the main screen of the program.
